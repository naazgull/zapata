================================

Zapata is a RESTful API development framework for **C++**. It follows the
_C++20_ standards and coding style, including _lambda_ functions,
_promisses_ and _assync_ programming. It has built-in support for MySQL,
PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, Oauth2.0 user authorization and
authentication. Finally, it has a really neat JSON support. It still lacks
documentation, that's a work in progress.
